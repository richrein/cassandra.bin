# Simple network bandwidth test
# Rich Rein 2014-2019
#
# This is not a full network test to load or measure a network.
# This is provides a quick sample of the minimum throughput of a single connection for a short amount of time.
# Platform specifics improvement are avoided to keep the simple and quick to use.
#
# Cat is used to push as many bytes as possible thought a single ssh TCP/IP connection.
# The dd utility is used to measure the amount of data received.
# Random and disabled compression is used where possible to sample the raw network throughput.

# 
# Complete blocks in dd:
# The dd utility is prone to reading short blocks from a network.
# The best solution is to use iflag=fullblock on the receiver (if the receiving dd recognizes it.)
# Else, use a small receiving block size (bs or ibs) like 1024 to ensure there is enough buffered for each block read.

blockSize=1024

#
# Use block count to increase the size of the test.

#blockCount=1000000

# Data source:
# Use /dev/urandom if available, else /dev/null
